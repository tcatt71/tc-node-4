## Declaring Variables

- Scopes

  - Global
  - Local
    - Block
    - Function

- Keywords

  - let
    - value can be reassigned
    - can't be redeclared
    - block scoped
  - var
    - value can be reassigned
    - can be redeclared
    - function scoped
  - const
    - value can't be reassigned
    - can't be redeclared
    - block scoped

- Creating a global variable
  1. Declare a variable outside of a local scope
  2. Assign a value to a new variable without a declaration keyword, ex: `name = "Ben";`

## Loops

- for
  - great for iterating over lists
- for/in
- for/of
- do/while
  - great if you want to loop to atleast run once
- while
  - great if you already have a value that the condition is based on, but could potentially never start the loop

## Functions

- Block of code that can be executed by invoking the name identifying a function
- How to declare a function:

  1. `function funcName(parameters) { // block of code }` // function declaration
  2. `const funcName = function (parameters) { // block of code }` // assigning a function declaration to a variable

  - To **invoke** a function, use the name with following parentheses: `funcName("two")`
  - **Hoisting** is where function declarations are hoisted, or moved to the top, of the file before script execution

- Function Parameters:
  - Input for a function
  - Expected parameters are defined in the function declaration within parentheses
  - Parameters names follow other JS conventions for naming variables, functions, etc
  - Parameter values come from passed in values, in order, from function invocation
  - Parameters are treated as immutable
  - Pure function
  - Anonymous function
